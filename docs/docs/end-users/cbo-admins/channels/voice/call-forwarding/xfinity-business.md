# Forward Xfinity Business Phone to Connie

This guide walks you through setting up call forwarding from your Xfinity Business phone number to your Connie phone system.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Active Xfinity Business phone service
- ✅ Connie phone number (provided by your Connie administrator)
- ✅ Access to Comcast Business VoiceEdge Portal (recommended) or your business phone
- ✅ Administrative access to your Xfinity Business account

## Step-by-Step Setup

You can activate call forwarding using two methods: star codes on your phone or through the Comcast Business VoiceEdge portal.

### Option A: Using Star Codes (*72) - Quick Setup

This method is quick and ideal for immediate setup.

1. **Pick up your Xfinity Business phone**
   - Lift the handset or press the "Talk"/"Answer" button to get a dial tone

2. **Dial *72**
   - For rotary phones, dial 1172

3. **Listen for the second dial tone**
   - This signals the system is ready to accept the forwarding number

4. **Enter your Connie phone number**
   - Dial the 10-digit number provided by Connie (e.g., 404-555-1234)
   - Use 7 digits for local numbers in the same area code
   - Use 1 + area code for long-distance domestic numbers (e.g., 1-404-555-1234)

5. **Wait for confirmation**
   - You'll hear a stutter dial tone or two short beeps, confirming activation
   - If the forwarded number answers, the setup is complete
   - If there's no answer or the line is busy, hang up and repeat within two minutes

6. **Hang up**
   - Call forwarding is now active, redirecting all incoming calls to Connie

### Option B: Using Comcast Business VoiceEdge Portal - Advanced Setup

This method offers more control and is suitable for managing settings online.

1. **Sign in to the VoiceEdge portal**
   - Go to [business.comcast.com](https://business.comcast.com)
   - Click "Sign In" and select "VoiceEdge User" or "My Account"
   - Enter your username and password
   - If you lack access, contact your account administrator

2. **Navigate to call forwarding settings**
   - Look for "Call Forwarding" or "Call Management" in the portal
   - Select your business phone number from the list

3. **Configure forwarding options**
   - Enable call forwarding
   - Enter your Connie phone number as the forwarding destination
   - Choose your forwarding preferences (see options below)

4. **Set forwarding rules**
   - **Always Forward**: All calls go directly to Connie
   - **Forward When Busy**: Only forward when your Xfinity line is busy
   - **Forward When No Answer**: Forward after a specified number of rings
   - **Forward When Unreachable**: Forward when service is unavailable

5. **Save and activate**
   - Click "Save" or "Apply" to activate the settings
   - The portal will confirm the changes

### Option C: Deactivating Call Forwarding

To turn off call forwarding:
- **Using star codes**: Dial *73 from your Xfinity Business phone
- **Using VoiceEdge portal**: Return to call forwarding settings and disable the feature

## Test the Setup

1. Call your Xfinity Business number from an external phone
2. Verify the call reaches your Connie system
3. Test different forwarding scenarios if applicable
4. Confirm caller ID appears correctly in Connie

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Calls not forwarding:**
- Verify the Connie phone number is entered correctly (10-digit format)
- Check that call forwarding is enabled in your settings
- Ensure your Xfinity Business plan supports call forwarding

**Calls forwarding but not reaching Connie:**
- Contact your Connie administrator to verify the number is configured
- Check for any geographic restrictions on the forwarding number
- Verify the forwarding number is active and operational

**Forwarding activation fails:**
- Try the star code method (*72) multiple times
- Ensure you're getting a dial tone before dialing *72
- Contact Xfinity Business support if star codes don't work

**VoiceEdge portal access issues:**
- Verify your login credentials with your account administrator
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try a different browser or incognito mode

## Important Notes

- Call forwarding charges may apply from Xfinity Business
- Some Xfinity Business plans include free call forwarding to local numbers
- Long-distance forwarding may incur additional charges
- You can disable forwarding at any time using *73 or the VoiceEdge portal
- Keep your Xfinity service active - canceling it will stop call forwarding
