<PluginLibraryFeature />

This feature provides the supervisor the ability to remotely complete an agents reservation that is in the wrapping status.

## setup and dependencies

There are no additional dependencies for setup beyond ensuring the flag is enabled within the `flex-config` attributes.

To enable the `Supervisor Complete Reservation` feature, under the `flex-config` attributes set the `supervisor_complete_reservation` `enabled` flag to `true`. You may also configure a custom `outcome` which will be displayed in Flex Insights.

```json
"supervisor_complete_reservation": {
  "enabled": true,
  "outcome": "Completed by supervisor"
}
```

## how does it work?

When enabled, this feature adds a button to the TaskOverviewCanvas that when clicked opens a dialog to confirm the completion of the task. Upon confirmation two requests are made:

- First, task attributes are updated to set the conversation outcome displayed Flex Insights based on the `outcome` setting
- Then, a request is made to a twilio function that takes the task sid and reservation id and updates the reservation to the completed state.
