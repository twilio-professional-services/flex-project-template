# Flex Project Template

The _Flex Project Template_ is a starting point for Flex solutions of any size. It provides a methodology for managing all the key artifacts of a Twilio Flex solution.  

- It can be used for large projects or simple standalone features
- Many of the most common features requested by Flex customers are packaged in the template
- Each feature is self contained and easily removed if desired  
- Features can be turned on and off using an [adminstration panel](https://twilio-professional-services.github.io/flex-project-template/feature-library/flex-v2/admin-ui)
- You can [deploy this solution and use it to build in just a few minutes](https://twilio-professional-services.github.io/flex-project-template/setup-guides/deploy-to-hosted-flex) by cloning the template and providing your account sid, api key and api secret.

The primary aims of this template are

1. To reduce the time to value when building with Flex
2. To Improve interoperability of features by proposing some standardization
3. To accelerate build velocity by removing the headaches developers have in threading all the pieces together
4. To provide a suite of easily accessible and working features for developers to learn from.

For more overview information around the methodology of the template, please visit the [How it works](https://twilio-professional-services.github.io/flex-project-template/how-it-works/overview) section of the documentation site.
